# Access State with useSelector

## Objectives

- Use the **React Redux** library to connect the store to the **React**
  application.
- Utilize the `<Provider />` component and the `useSelector` hook to access
  **Redux** store content.

## Overview

In this lesson, we want to explore how `useSelector` is used to connect
regular React components with the **Redux** store. This is also a good
opportunity to review the steps for using the `redux` and `react-redux`
packages in your app.

## Instructions

Some files are provided, including `UserInput` and the reducer in the
`usersSlice.js` file, but the **Redux** store isn't fully hooked up yet.

### Connecting to Redux

In `src/index.js`, use the `createStore` method from `redux`, passing in the
provided reducer, `usersReducer`, to create a `store`. Use `Provider` from
`react-redux` to wrap `<App />`, passing `store` as a prop to the `Provider`.
This will give your components access to the store.

### Test by Dispatching an Action

Run `npm start` and open up your browser's dev console. If everything is
connected correctly in `index.js`, a form should appear in the browser.
Submitting something using the form will cause a `console.log` to fire in our
reducer, indicating that the values have been added to our store.

In `UserInput.js`, we can see the code that fires when we press the submit
button:

```jsx
// ...

function handleOnSubmit(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  dispatch({ type: "users/add", payload: formData });
}

return <form onSubmit={handleOnSubmit}>{/* ... */}</form>;
```

We can see that, _on submit_, `handleOnSubmit()` is called.
`event.preventDefault()` is called to stop the page from refreshing, then
`dispatch()` is called with a custom action,
`{type: 'users/add', payload: formData}`.

The `dispatch` function is provided by calling the `useDispatch` hook from
**React Redux** in our component

### Using the useSelector Hook

Now that we've got a working store, we want to get access to it and display the
contents of our store's state.

1. Import the `useSelector` hook in `Users.js`

2. Call `useSelector` inside your component, passing in a callback function that
   accepts one argument, `state`, the current version of your store's state. Use
   `state` to access the array of `users` and return that from the callback
   function. Save the return value of calling `useSelector` to a variable so
   that you can use the `users` array in your component.

The Users component should display the username of a user submitted to the
store. To pass the final test, it should also display a total count of current
users. Try to use `useSelector` to solve both. You can call `useSelector`
multiple times to return different values: one for `users` and one for the
`userCount`.

## Conclusion

With all tests passing, you should have a working form that adds and
successfully displays usernames, as well as a total count of those users. While
these are small bits of data, we've got a fully integrated React/Redux
application, ready to be expanded upon!
